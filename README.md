CLASSIFICATION ON IRIS FLOWER DATASET

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using the famous Iris Dataset.
It is a beginner-friendly machine learning classification project that demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is the Iris Dataset, which contains 150 samples with 4 features each:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Each sample belongs to one of the three Iris flower species.

Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Workflow
Load the Iris dataset
Perform data exploration and visualization
Split data into training and testing sets
Train multiple classification models
Evaluate models using accuracy and confusion matrix
Predict flower species based on input features

Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
Classification Report
Confusion Matrix
This helps in comparing the performance of different algorithms.

Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
